# Twine Game Design
### Used Twine Sugarcube and then export it in the form of HTML.

1) I created a fictional character, that takes up the name entered by the user.
2) The character is a musician who is slowly rising to fame.
3) As the users move through the story, they will encounter various situations they face as their fame grows. Depending on what they choose, they will encounter new situations in the story.
4) I decided to keep fame and loneliness as parameters that increase or decrease depending on what the player choose in those different situations.
5) In the end a score is calculated and based on that score a story is painted for the user.
